<p>
This years event will be held at the University of Colorado at Boulder.
The American Modelica Conference is the premier event for
the Modelica community and everyone who is interested in simulation of
cyber-physical systems based on open standards should attend.  The
topics at this event will focus on Modelica for physical system
modeling and the Functional-Mockup-Interface FMI for model exchange
and co-simulation. The event features tutorials to learn about these
technologies as well as news and the latest trends in the system
simulation community.  And, of course, this year's event will also
feature presentations from industrial and academic users to share
their experiences and those will be accompanied by a keynote speech as
well.

<h1>NA-MUG 2017: System Modeling and Simulation with Open Standards</h1>

<h4><b>Where</b>:<br>
Stanford Linear Accelerator Lab<br>
Menlo Park, California<br>
</h4>
<h4><b>When</b>: August 3rd and 4th, 2017</h4>

<p>
  This years event will be held in the famous Stanford Linear
Accelerator Lab facility. The NA-MUG meeting is the premier event for
the Modelica community and everyone who is interested in simulation of
cyber-physical systems based on open standards should attend.  The
topics at this event will focus on Modelica for physical system
modeling and the Functional-Mockup-Interface FMI for model exchange
and co-simulation. The event features tutorials to learn about these
technologies as well as news and the latest trends in the system
simulation community.  And, of course, this year's event will also
feature presentations from industrial and academic users to share
their experiences and those will be accompanied by a keynote speech as
well.

  The agenda and an EventBrite regisration page will be posted as
soon as it has been finalized.

<h1>NA-MUG 2017: System Modeling and Simulation with Open Standards</h1>

<h4><b>Where</b>:<br>
Stanford Linear Accelerator Lab<br>
Menlo Park, California<br>
</h4>
<h4><b>When</b>: August 3rd and 4th, 2017</h4>

<p>
  This years event will be held in the famous Stanford Linear
Accelerator Lab facility. The NA-MUG meeting is the premier event for
the Modelica community and everyone who is interested in simulation of
cyber-physical systems based on open standards should attend.  The
topics at this event will focus on Modelica for physical system
modeling and the Functional-Mockup-Interface FMI for model exchange
and co-simulation. The event features tutorials to learn about these
technologies as well as news and the latest trends in the system
simulation community.  And, of course, this year's event will also
feature presentations from industrial and academic users to share
their experiences and those will be accompanied by a keynote speech as
well.

<h2>Keynote</h2>
<h3>The Myth of Accuracy - 2 Decades On</h3>
<h4>Speaker: Damian Harty</h4>
<p>Damian has had a very diverse career since graduating from Loughborough University in the UK in 1990. Along the way he added a Master's degree from the University of Hertfordshire in 1999. Technically his career started with structural and fatigue analysis of metallic structures, then into vibrational analysis of structures and systems and then on to the large amplitude non-linear domain for systems. This final area has held his attention for quite some time. He has spent time in industry and in academia; he collaborated with Professor Mike Blundell for "The Multibody Systems Approach to Vehicle Dynamics", published in 2004 and revised in 2014. In industry, he has worked on products from 2 to 10 wheels, and also some with tracks and skis. He has worked as both consultant and client. As well as analytical work, he has spent a great deal of time in the real world, measuring and developing motorcycles, rally cars, passenger cars and even some military vehicles. Geographically he recently moved to California to take up the role of Chassis Director for Lucid Motors, in which capacity he is employed today. Getting him to talk is easy; it's getting him to shut up that is the problem.</p>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>As computing power continues to track Moore's Law, numerical modelling - the once "poor cousin" of classical mathematics - has become an indispensible and unstoppable force in shaping product design. In 1999, I asked questions about whether or not we should always make the most accurate models possible. If I were being accurate with the title, I would say "1.8 decades on", but the whole point of this conversation is to challenge traditional conversations about the relationship of accuracy and value.</p>

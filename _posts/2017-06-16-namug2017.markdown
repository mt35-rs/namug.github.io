<h1>NA-MUG 2017: System Modeling and Simulation with Open Standards</h1>

<h4><b>Where</b>:<br>
Stanford Linear Accelerator Lab<br>
Menlo Park, California<br>
</h4>
<h4><b>When</b>: August 3rd and 4th, 2017</h4>

<p>
  This years event will be held in the famous Stanford Linear
Accelerator Lab facility. The NA-MUG meeting is the premier event for
the Modelica community and everyone who is interested in simulation of
cyber-physical systems based on open standards should attend.  The
topics at this event will focus on Modelica for physical system
modeling and the Functional-Mockup-Interface FMI for model exchange
and co-simulation. The event features tutorials to learn about these
technologies as well as news and the latest trends in the system
simulation community.  And, of course, this year's event will also
feature presentations from industrial and academic users to share
their experiences and those will be accompanied by a keynote speech as
well.
</p>

<h5>Call for Presentations</h5>
<p>
We invite participants to submit proposals for presentations at this years event.  Submissions should be related in some way to Modelica and/or FMI and discuss interesting problems or projects that have leveraged these technologies.  Please send them to me and I will collect them for review by the board.  <strong>Submissions should be submitted by July 16th</strong>.  Authors will be notified by July 20th.
</p>

<p>If you have a presentation you would like to give, please send it to <a href="michael.tiller+namug2017@gmail.com">me</a>.</p>


<h5>Call for Tutorials</h5>
<p>
We also invite participants to submit proposals for tutorials.  Each tutorial should last no more than 3 hours and should include a "hands-on-experience" session (participants are expected to bring their own laptop; the presenter will provide the presented tools). If you are interested in presenting a tutorial, please send me an email, providing title, presenter(s), and an abstract of the tutorial. <strong>The deadline for application is July 5th, 2017</strong>; however, as only a limited number of tutorials can be held in parallel, we advise you to apply as early as possible.</p>
<p>Tutorials are free for the participants, but content should focus on teaching people about useful technologies and not on marketing a particular tool or vendor.</p>
<p>Decision about the acceptance of tutorials will be based upon Modelica/FMI relation of content, how educational they are, and on the time of application.</p>

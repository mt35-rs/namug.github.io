<p>
Product development increasingly concerns the selection of product
platforms which cover a range of offerings for different
customers. The consideration of architecture is a critical element in
product development and in particular the selection of architecture
can offer to the customer significant benefits obtained through
integration of components and subsystems.
</p>
<p>
The definition of underlying and reusable architectures –
here considering architectures broadly as connections of
components and considering views of functional, physical,
control and network architectural elements – is a critical
aspect of product development. This talk considers the state
of technology to identify, evaluate and optimize
architectures and the opportunities and challenges for the
Modelica community in these architecture studies.
</p>
<p>
The talk will review some major architectural advances for
product lines in the history of UTC. The development
processes that can be used in the ``front end'' of defining
architectures including work at JPL (“Team X”) and some work
at UTC (“ITAPS'”) will be reviewed. The overall state of
needs and matching technology including requirements capture
and formalization, use of design principles as Platform
Based Design and the state of tool chain development will be
reviewed. Specific uses for Modelica that can be used in
these architectural studies that enable speed and certain
analyses including robust design and optimization will be
covered.
